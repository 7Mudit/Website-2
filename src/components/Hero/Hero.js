                    <p className="printerConnectParagraph">A wireless printer can be used by many different devices through network. If you have a Wi-Fi or traditional (wired) network printer, you can directly connect it to the network. But if the printer isnâ€™t network-enabled, you can add it as a local printer and share it on your network. We will teach you how to add a network printer on Windows or macOS, as well as how to share a local printer with your network.</p>

                    <p className="printerConnectParagraph">A Printer driver is a piece of software designed to help your printer communicate with your mobile device or computer. We allow your HP Printer, to talk directly with your device. This allows the machinery to understand data sent from a device (such as a picture you want to print or a document you want to scan), and perform the necessary actions. Think of your HP printer driver as the translator who helps your technology to communicate more effectively.</p>
